# tencentcloud_mysql_instance

Provides a mysql instance resource to create master database instances.

~> **NOTE:** If this mysql has readonly instance, the terminate operation of the mysql does NOT take effect immediately, maybe takes for several hours. so during that time, VPCs associated with that mysql instance can't be terminated also.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "tencentcloud_mysql_instance" "default" {
  internet_service = 1
  engine_version   = "5.7"

  root_password     = "********"
  slave_deploy_mode = 0
  first_slave_zone  = "ap-guangzhou-4"
  second_slave_zone = "ap-guangzhou-4"
  slave_sync_mode   = 1
  availability_zone = "ap-guangzhou-4"
  project_id        = 201901010001
  instance_name     = "myTestMysql"
  mem_size          = 128000
  volume_size       = 250
  vpc_id            = "vpc-12mt3l31"
  subnet_id         = "subnet-9uivyb1g"
  intranet_port     = 3306
  security_groups   = ["sg-ot8eclwz"]

  tags = {
    name = "test"
  }

  parameters = {
    max_connections = "1000"
  }
}
```
