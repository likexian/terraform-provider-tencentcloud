# tencentcloud_instance

Provides a CVM instance resource.

~> **NOTE:** You can launch an CVM instance for a VPC network via specifying parameter `vpc_id`. One instance can only belong to one VPC.

~> **NOTE:** At present, 'PREPAID' instance cannot be deleted and must wait it to be outdated and released automatically.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "tencentcloud_image" "my_favorate_image" {
  os_name = "ubuntu"

  filter {
    name   = "image-type"
    values = ["PUBLIC_IMAGE"]
  }
}

data "tencentcloud_instance_types" "my_favorate_instance_types" {
  filter {
    name   = "instance-family"
    values = ["S1"]
  }

  cpu_core_count = 1
  memory_size    = 1
}

data "tencentcloud_availability_zones" "my_favorate_zones" {}

// Create Security Group with 2 rules
resource "tencentcloud_security_group" "app" {
  name        = "web accessibility"
  description = "make it accessible for both production and stage ports"
}

  ip_protocol       = "tcp"
  port_range        = "80,3000,8080"
  policy            = "accept"
}
resource "tencentcloud_security_group_rule" "ssh" {

  name              = "awesome_app_subnet"
  cidr_block        = "10.0.1.0/24"
}

// Create 10 CVM instances to host awesome_app

  key_name          = "${tencentcloud_key_pair.random_key.id}"

  security_groups = [
    "${tencentcloud_security_group.app.id}",
  ]
  
  vpc_id    = "${tencentcloud_vpc.app.id}"
  subnet_id = "${tencentcloud_subnet.app.id}"
  
  internet_max_bandwidth_out = 20
  count                      = 10
}
